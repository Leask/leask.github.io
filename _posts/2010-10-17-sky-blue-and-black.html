<p>最近室友们开始看Friends了,这部我看了不下3次的美剧由于太过经典,他们看的时候我也还会忍不住瞄上几眼.</p>
<p>心血来潮也转一下里面的一首插曲,如果我没有记错,yifeng前辈最近也贴过了.我也不多介绍了.</p>
<p>Sky Blue And Black</p>
<p>Lyric by&nbsp;Browne and Jackson</p>
<p>In the calling out to one another<br />
Of the lovers up and down the strand<br />
In the sound of the waves and the cries<br />
Of the seagulls circling the sand<br />
In the fragments of the songs<br />
Carried down the wind from some radio<br />
In the murmuring of the city in the distance<br />
Ominous and low</p>
<p>I hear the sound of the world where we played<br />
And the far too simple beauty<br />
Of the promises we made</p>
<p>If you ever need holding<br />
Call my name, I'll be there<br />
If you ever need holding<br />
And no holding back, I'll see you through<br />
Sky blue and black</p>
<p>Where the touch of the lover ends<br />
And the soul of the friend begins<br />
There's a need to be separate and a need to be one<br />
And a struggle neither wins<br />
Where you gave me the world I was in<br />
And a place I could make a stand<br />
I could never see how you doubted me<br />
When I'd let go of your hand</p>
<p>Yeah, and I was much younger then<br />
And I must have thought that I would know<br />
If things were going to end</p>
<p>And the heavens were rolling<br />
Like a wheel on a track<br />
And our sky was unfolding<br />
And it'll never fold back<br />
Sky blue and black</p>
<p>And I'd have fought the world for you<br />
If I thought that you wanted me to<br />
Or put aside what was true or untrue<br />
If I'd known that's what you needed<br />
What you needed me to do</p>
<p>But the moment has passed by me now<br />
To have put away my pride<br />
And just come through for you somehow</p>
<p>If you ever need holding<br />
Call my name, I'll be there<br />
If you ever need holding<br />
And no holding back, I'll see you through</p>
<p>You're the color of the sky<br />
Reflected in each store-front window pane<br />
You're the whispering and the sighing<br />
Of my tires in the rain<br />
You're the hidden cost and the thing that's lost<br />
In everything I do<br />
Yeah and I'll never stop looking for you<br />
In the sunlight and the shadows<br />
And the faces on the avenue<br />
That's the way love is<br />
That's the way love is<br />
That's the way love is<br />
Sky blue and black</p>
<p>PS: 总有一首歌能唱出你的徘徊,你的无奈,对于现在的我,就是这么一首歌.</p>
