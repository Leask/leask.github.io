<p>Do You Hear the People Sing? by Les Miserables Cast<br />
ENJOLRAS<br />
Do you hear the people sing?<br />
Singing a song of angry men?<br />
It is the music of a people<br />
Who will not be slaves again!<br />
When the beating of your heart<br />
Echoes the beating of the drums<br />
There is a life about to start<br />
When tomorrow comes!</p>
<p>COMBEFERRE<br />
Will you join in our crusade?<br />
Who will be strong and stand with me?<br />
Beyond the barricade<br />
Is there a world you long to see?<br />
Courfeyrac:<br />
Then join in the fight<br />
That will give you the right to be free!</p>
<p>ALL<br />
Do you hear the people sing?<br />
Singing a song of angry men?<br />
It is the music of a people<br />
Who will not be slaves again!<br />
When the beating of your heart<br />
Echoes the beating of the drums<br />
There is a life about to start<br />
When tomorrow comes!</p>
<p>FEUILLY<br />
Will you give all you can give<br />
So that our banner may advance<br />
Some will fall and some will live<br />
Will you stand up and take your chance?<br />
The blood of the martyrs<br />
Will water the meadows of France!</p>
<p>ALL<br />
Do you hear the people sing?<br />
Singing a song of angry men?<br />
It is the music of a people<br />
Who will not be slaves again!<br />
When the beating of your heart<br />
Echoes the beating of the drums<br />
There is a life about to start<br />
When tomorrow comes!</p>
