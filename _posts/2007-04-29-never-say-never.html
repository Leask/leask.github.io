<br /><br />
<br />Reuters asked Steve Jobs whether the iTunes store would ever adopt a subscription based approach to music... &ldquo;Never say never, but customers don&rsquo;t seem to be interested in it,&rdquo; Jobs said. &ldquo;The subscription model has failed so far.&rdquo; Quite right. However there can be no doubt that a &ldquo;renting" model has worked for decades...the home video business<br />
