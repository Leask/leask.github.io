<p>听说哥哥老婆的肚子已经鼓起来了，12月就要诞下宝宝了。<br />
嫂嫂发来一张彩色超声波照片，让我十分震撼。<br />
让我想起 C&eacute;line Dion&nbsp;的&nbsp;MIRACLE，歌词写得很美，分享给大家。<br />
祝天下宝宝健康成长。</p>
<p>MIRACLE</p>
<p>Lyrics: Linda Thompson<br />
Music: Stephen Dorff</p>
<p>You're my life's one miracle<br />
Everything I've done that's good<br />
And you break my heart with tenderness<br />
And I confess it's true<br />
I never knew a love like this 'til you</p>
<p>You're the reason I was born<br />
Now I finally know for sure<br />
And I'm overwhelmed with happiness<br />
So blessed to hold you close<br />
The one that I love most<br />
Though the future has so much for you in store<br />
Who could ever love you more</p>
<p>The nearest thing to heaven<br />
You're my angel from above<br />
Only God creates such perfect love</p>
<p>When you smile AT me I cry<br />
And to save your life I'd die<br />
With a romance that is pure in heart<br />
You are my dearest part<br />
Whatever it requires<br />
I live for your desires<br />
Forget my own, your needs will come before<br />
Who could ever love you more</p>
<p>There is nothing you could ever do<br />
To make me stop loving you<br />
And every breath I take<br />
Is always for your sake<br />
You sleep inside my dreams<br />
And know for sure<br />
Who could ever love you more</p>
