<div id="msgcns!15BAC1A170471DB!2148" class="bvMsg">It's not the first time that I want to drop Live Spaces and use another blog system.<br />
<br />But now, I really want to do this.<br />
<br />In fact I just need a very simple public system to post my writings and my pictures.<br />
<br />Unfortunately I can't find a perfect one.<br />
<br />I've tried so many blog systems but at last I have to disappoint.<br />
<br />The major problem is all the blog systems can't work well with Mac OS.<br />
<br />So I have to remove some modules from my Live Space because this same reason.<br />
<br />I am so sorry if you are a M$ Windows user.<br />
<br />I done this just because I want my pages show a same effect between Windows or Mac.</div></p>
