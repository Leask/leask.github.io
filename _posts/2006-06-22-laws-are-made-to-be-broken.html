<br /><br />
<br />Isaac Asimov, who, in my opinion, is a great writer, published his three laws in a short story called "Runaround" in 1942. The laws are about robots and human being.<br />
<br />The three laws were stated as follows:<br />
<br /><br />
<br />1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br />
<br />2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br />
<br />3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />"i.Robot", the story is also from Isaac Asimov, is amazing but it will be real, I think.</div></p>
