<p><span>Look at the picture.<br />
</span>It is a screenshot I made from iPad 2 conference, March 2nd just past.</p>
<p>This image has been exhibited many times by Steve Jobs.<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in Apple&rsquo;s DNA that technology is not enough,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<p>more below:<br />
"It&rsquo;s tech married with the liberal arts and the humanities. Nowhere is that more true than in the post-PC products. Our competitors are looking at this like it&rsquo;s the next PC market. That is not the right approach to this. These are post-PC devices that need to be easier to use than a PC, more intuitive. and the software, hardware, and applications need to intertwine in an even more seamless way than on a PC. We think we&rsquo;re on track with this."</p>
<p>I think that's why Apple can make great products again and again.<br />
Also it's the reason why I love Apple and what we need to think about as a full time developer:<br />
To make cool things full of liberal arts and humanities to everyone with powerful tech.</p>
<p>It's just the beginning of the great time about cloud computing, mobile internet and some other cool stuffs.<br />
And it's the right timing for us to grow our self to catch more opportunities.</p>
<p>When and where to begin?<br />
It began already, from our everyday's working.<br />
Go ahead, guys.</p>
