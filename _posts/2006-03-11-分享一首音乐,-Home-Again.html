<div id="msgcns!15BAC1A170471DB!1470" class="bvMsg">Sometimes I wonder If I'm ever gonna make it home again<br /><br />
It's so far and out of sight<br /><br />
I really need someone to talk to And nobody else knows how to comfort me tonight<br /><br />
Snow is cold, rain is wet<br /><br />
Chills my soul right to the marrow<br /><br />
I won't be happy 'till I see you alone again 'till I'm home again and feeling right<br /><br />
I wanna be home again and feeling right<br /></div></p>
