<br /><br />
<br />Verse 1<br />
<br />The last that ever she saw him, carried away by a moonlight shadown,<br />
<br />He passed on worried and warning, carried away by a moonlight shadown,<br />
<br />Lost in a riddle that Saturday night, far away on the other side,<br />
<br />he was caught in the middle of a desperate fight, and she couldn't find how to push through.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Verse 2<br />
<br />The trees that whisper in the evening, carried away by a moonlight shadown,<br />
<br />Sing the song of sorrow and grieving, carried away by a moonlight shadown,<br />
<br />All she saw was a silhouette of a gun, far away on the other side,<br />
<br />He was shot six times by a man on the run, and she couldn't find how to push through.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Verse 3<br />
<br />Four a.m. in the morning, carried away by a moonlight shadown,<br />
<br />I watched your vision forming, carried away by a moonlight shadow,<br />
<br />Star was glowin' in a silvery night, far away on the other side,<br />
<br />Will you come to talk to me this night, but she couldn't find how to push through.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Bridge:<br />
<br />I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven far away,<br />
<br />I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven one day<br />
<br /><br />
