<br />Microsoft(R) Firefox 2007 Professional<br />
<br />The new award-winning browser from Microsoft is now faster, securer and quicker anything else on the market. Why use anything else?<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Enjoy a Better Web Experience<br />
<br />MS Firefox 2007 delivers a dramatic boost in the download speeds of online pornography. By utilising a proprietary dynamic algorithm - anything that remotely resembles a tit or a boob will download up to 10 times faster. Fun at the speed of light!<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Stay Secure on the Web<br />
<br />Firefox 2007's new TakeOver(TM) technology protects the Windows Kernel by automatically recognizing all McAfee and Symantec programs as viruses. Downloading has never been safer.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Interactive Multimedia<br />
<br />Microsoft's AKobe Phlash(TM) Plugin delivers awesome online interactive content; anything from music, videos to games. (Lawsuit from Adobe pending)<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Personalize Your Browser<br />
<br />Choose from three excellent browsing styles! Minimized, Maximized and Fullscreen!<br />
<br /><br />
<br />System Requirements<br />
<br />The following bare minimums are essential for the optimum operation of MS Firefox 2007<br />
<br />A Credit Card<br />
<br />Microsoft(R) Windows(TM)/Vista Operating System<br />
<br />Microsoft(R) Mouse &amp; Keyboard (Hyperlinks will NOT work without these)<br />
<br />Live(TM) Messenger (Required API to maintain dangerous CPU temperatures)<br />
<br />Microsoft(R) Office 2007 (Provides the ability to scroll webpages)<br />
<br />Quad Core Processor (For loading Hotmail.com)<br />
<br />Any SLI Configured Graphics Card > 512mb (TO Display High Definition GIF Images)<br />
<br />1024 MB of RAM (Compensation for Frequent Memory Leaks)<br />
<br />483MB Disk Space<br />
<br /><br />
