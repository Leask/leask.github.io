<div>Lost Without You<br /><br />
-- Darren Hayes<br /><br />
-- Aria Awards 2003<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I know I can be a little stubborn sometimes<br /><br />
I must say, a little righteous and too proud<br /><br />
I just want to find a way to compromise<br /><br />
'Cause I believe that we can work things out<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I thought I had all the answers<br /><br />
Never giving in<br /><br />
But baby I was wrong<br /><br />
I admit that I was wrong<br /><br />
<br /><br />
All I know is I'm lost without you<br /><br />
I'm not gonna lie<br /><br />
How am I gonna be strong without you<br /><br />
I need you by my side<br /><br />
<br /><br />
And if we ever said we'll never be together<br /><br />
and we ended it with goodbye<br /><br />
I don't know what I'd do<br /><br />
You know I've been lost without you<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I keep trying to find my way<br /><br />
but all I know is<br /><br />
Im lost without you<br /><br />
I keep trying to face the day<br /><br />
I'm lost without you<br /><br />
<br /><br />
How am I ever gonna get rid of these blues?<br /><br />
Baby i'm so lonely all the time<br /><br />
Everywhere I go I get so confused<br /><br />
You know that you're the only thing that's on my mind<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Oh my bed's so cold at night<br /><br />
I miss you more each day<br /><br />
Only you can make it right<br /><br />
No I'm not too proud to say<br /><br />
<br /><br />
All I know is I'm lost without you<br /><br />
I'm not gonna lie<br /><br />
How am I gonna be strong without you<br /><br />
I need you by my side<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If we ever said we'll never be together<br /><br />
and we ended with goodbye<br /><br />
I don't know what I'd do<br /><br />
You know I've been lost without you<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I keep trying to find my way<br /><br />
And all I know is<br /><br />
I'm lost without you<br /><br />
I keep trying to face the day<br /><br />
I'm lost without you<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If I could only hold you now<br /><br />
Make the pain just go away<br /><br />
Can't stop the tears from running down my face<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Oh<br /><br />
All I know is I'm lost without you<br /><br />
I'm not gonna lie<br /><br />
How am I gonna be strong without you<br /><br />
I need you by my side<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If we ever said we'll never be together<br /><br />
and we ended with goodbye<br /><br />
I don't know what I'd do<br /><br />
You know I've been lost without you<br /><br />
<br /><br />
PS: 又到了分手得季节了，大家保重。</div><br />
