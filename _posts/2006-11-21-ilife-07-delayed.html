<div id="msgcns!15BAC1A170471DB!2093" class="bvMsg">Steve, listen to a guy who teaches people iLife one on one everyday. Please take this year off and think hard about the iLife suite. I&rsquo;ll forgo the year in exchange for a free downloaded update for more features&#47;fixes to &lsquo;06.<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>Here is why:<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>10.5 presumably is the middle child in a series of fine operating systems. Vista is coming out soon, and it&rsquo;s a good chance Microsoft is going to push it&rsquo;s hardware partners to promote it. A product Microsoft has put close to a decade into developing isn&rsquo;t something they will not pay attention too.<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>Right now there is an edge into gaining some ground; Boot Camp and Intel help a lot, as well as the attention put into the Mac software up to this point(not just Apple there&hellip;). Perhaps but hard to prove, is the few million iPods sold over the last couple of years giving a bit of a boost in sales.<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>iLife &lsquo;06 is great in many aspects. As Thurrott said, unmatched in the PC world is iLife &lsquo;06. Apple could do us a favor and take this year off to work on just catching up to what this thing can do for us. Honestly, many .Mac members are not using the full capability of the service and I think a year of rest would help them find out just how convienient and fun it is to use.<br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;>We expect you to put out &lsquo;07 in six or eight months, and it will have iWeb 2 and more bling bling than Snoop D-O-Dubble-Guhzizzle. So do what is unexpected, give us a break on the upgrades! I would rather see Apple extend things than see iLife &lsquo;07. Where can you go on the web and get free or low cost themes for the iLife apps? People look to Apple for these, and are let down when they find that what the package comes with is all Apple provides. Why not create a portal on apple.com that hosts additional things for iLife such as themes, loops, and graphics?<&#47;div></p>
