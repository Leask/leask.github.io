<br />Welcome to Macenstein&rsquo;s&ldquo;Mac Chick of the Month&rdquo;.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Each month we will be featuring a different die-hard, Mac-loving girl who is (almost) as well designed as the Apple products they love.<br />
We are very excited to kick of this new monthly feature with the lovely Christina, an award winning freelance sound designer and long-time Apple fan.<br />

<br />Christina is a recent graduate of the Berklee College of Music in Boston where she majored in Music Synthesis.<br />
During her tenure at Berklee, Christina received Berklee&rsquo;s Laurie Anderson Women in Music Technology Award for excellence within her major. She participated in the school&rsquo;s electronic music performance group, who had its first show at the 2005 Boston MacWorld event at the Berklee Performance Center.<br />
