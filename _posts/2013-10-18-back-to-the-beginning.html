<p>Lyrics of "The Call"</p>
<p>It started out as a feeling<br />
Which then grew into a hope<br />
Which then turned into a quiet thought<br />
Which then turned into a quiet word<br />
And then that word grew louder and louder<br />
'Til it was a battle cry<br />
I'll come back when you call me<br />
No need to say goodbye</p>
<p>Just because everything's changing<br />
Doesn't mean it's never been this way before<br />
All you can do is try to know who your friends are<br />
As you head off to the war<br />
Pick a star on the dark horizon and follow the light<br />
You'll come back when it's over<br />
No need to say goodbye<br />
You'll come back when it's over<br />
No need to say goodbye</p>
<p>Now we're back to the beginning<br />
It's just a feeling and no one knows yet<br />
But just because they can't feel it too<br />
Doesn't mean that you have to forget<br />
Let your memories grow stronger and stronger<br />
'Til they're before your eyes<br />
You'll come back when they call you<br />
No need to say goodbye<br />
You'll come back when they call you<br />
No need to say goodbye</p>
