<br /><br />
<br />Welcome to The iTunes Store, the best place to preview, buy, and download music, ever. You're about to experience downloading done right! Keep this email in a safe place for future reference. It includes important information about your account.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Here's all you need to get started<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Your Apple ID or .Mac account is:<br />
